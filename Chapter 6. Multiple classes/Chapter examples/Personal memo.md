#About Package and Import 

Package is a form to organize the codes (classes). 
The purpose is to group the classes in different directories to make a clean project.

To execute code with a Package, firstly needs to import the other packages to resolve 
the dependencies. After that, needs to execute the javac with all java files and create 
each directory to allocate their respective class files. Or simply execute the next command 
on terminal:

~~~
javac -d <directory of main class> <main class>
~~~
