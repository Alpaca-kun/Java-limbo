# Static Keyword

**_Static_** is a modifier which is applicable for the following members:
1. Blocks
2. Variables
3. Methods
4. Nested classes

Basically, when a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created and without reference to any object.

# Static Member

A method with _static_ keyword is called a __Static Method or Class Method__. The combination of Static Field and Static Method is called a __Static Member__.
If a method is declared statically, it has the three following effects: 
1. The method itself will belong to a class
2. It can be called from instances
3. It can be called without any instantiation
